# Diffie-Helman Key-Exchange
Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange, using simple RAW-Sockets in Python.

# Run the code

## Dependencys
* python3 installed

## Start the Programm
To run the Code, simply start the Main.py using python3 with the -m parameter in the following order
1. Start Main.py with -m=server
2. Start Main.py with -m=client

## Options
When starting with the -d or --debug Flag, the program prints some information to the stdout, to see exactly which informations are shared between client and server

# How it works
When starting with -m=server the Application creates an TCP-Server Socket on the localhost on Port 50000.
When starting with -m=client the Application connects to an TCP Socket on the localhost on Port 50000.
If you wish to connect to a remote server, simply modify the following line in Main.py:

    server = "localhost" # input("Server IP: ")

to

    server = input("Server IP: ")

After successfully establishing the socket-connection, the Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange starts working
